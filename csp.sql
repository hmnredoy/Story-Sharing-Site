(1, 'Beauty! Is that really a thing?', 'Symptoms of insomnia:[15]Difficulty falling asleep, including difficulty finding a comfortable sleeping positionWaking during the night, being unable to return to sleep and waking up earlyNot able to focus on daily tasks, difficulty in rememberingdaytime sleepiness, irritability, depression or anxietyFeeling fatigued or having low energy during the day [16]Trouble concentratingBeing irritable, acting aggressive or impulsiveSleep-onset insomnia is difficulty falling asleep at the beginning of the night, often a symptom of anxiety disorders. Delayed sleep phase disorder can be misdiagnosed as insomnia, as sleep onset is delayed to much later than normal while awakening spills over into daylight hours.[17]It is common for patients who have difficulty falling asleep to also have nocturnal awakenings with difficulty returning to sleep. Two-thirds of these patients wake up in the middle of the night, with more than half having trouble falling back to sleep after a middle-of-the-night awakening.[18]Early morning awakening is an awakening occurring earlier (more than 30 minutes) than desired with an inability to go back to sleep, and before total sleep time reaches 6.5 hours. Early morning awakening is often a characteristic of depression.[19]Poor sleep qualityPoor sleep quality can occur as a result of, for example, restless legs, sleep apnea or major depression. Poor sleep quality is defined as the individual not reaching stage 3 or delta sleep which has restorative properties.[20]Major depression leads to alterations in the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, causing excessive release of cortisol which can lead to poor sleep quality.Nocturnal polyuria, excessive nighttime urination, can be very disturbing to sleep.[21]SubjectivityMain article: Sleep state misperceptionSome cases of insomnia are not really insomnia in the traditional sense, because people experiencing sleep state misperception often sleep for a normal amount of time.[22] The problem is that, despite sleeping for multiple hours each night and typically not experiencing significant daytime sleepiness or other symptoms of sleep loss, they do not feel like they have slept very much, if at all.[22] Because their perception of their sleep is incomplete, they incorrectly believe it takes them an abnormally long time to fall asleep, and they underestimate how long they remain asleep.[22]CausesSymptoms of insomnia can be caused by or be associated with:Use of psychoactive drugs (such as stimulants), including certain medications, herbs, caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamines, methylphenidate, aripiprazole, MDMA, modafinil, or excessive alcohol intake.[23]Use of or withdrawal from alcohol and other sedatives, such as anti-anxiety and sleep drugs like benzodiazepines.[23]Use of or withdrawal from pain-relievers such as opioids.[23]Previous thoracic surgery.Heart disease.[24]Deviated nasal septum and nocturnal breathing disorders.[25]Restless legs syndrome, which can cause sleep onset insomnia due to the discomforting sensations felt and the need to move the legs or other body parts to relieve these sensations.[26]Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), which occurs during sleep and can cause arousals of which the sleeper is unaware.[27]Pain,[28] an injury or condition that causes pain can preclude an individual from finding a comfortable position in which to fall asleep, and can in addition cause awakening.Hormone shifts such as those that precede menstruation and those during menopause.[29]Life events such as fear, stress, anxiety, emotional or mental tension, work problems, financial stress, birth of a child, and bereavement.[26]Gastrointestinal issues such as heartburn or constipation.[30]Mental disorders such as bipolar disorder, clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, dementia,[31]:326 and ADHD.[32]Disturbances of the circadian rhythm, such as shift work and jet lag, can cause an inability to sleep at some times of the day and excessive sleepiness at other times of the day. Chronic circadian rhythm disorders are characterized by similar symptoms.[23]Certain neurological disorders, brain lesions, or a history of traumatic brain injury.[33]Medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis.[34]Abuse of over-the counter or prescription sleep aids (sedative or depressant drugs) can produce rebound insomnia.[23]Poor sleep hygiene, e.g., noise or over-consumption of caffeine.[23]A rare genetic condition can cause a prion-based, permanent and eventually fatal form of insomnia called fatal familial insomnia.[35]Physical exercise. Exercise-induced insomnia is common in athletes in the form of prolonged sleep onset latency.[36]Increased exposure to the blue light from artificial sources, such as phones or computers[37]Sleep studies using polysomnography have suggested that people who have sleep disruption have elevated nighttime levels of circulating cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone. They also have an elevated metabolic rate, which does not occur in people who do not have insomnia but whose sleep is intentionally disrupted during a sleep study. Studies of brain metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) scans indicate that people with insomnia have higher metabolic rates by night and by day. The question remains whether these changes are the causes or consequences of long-term insomnia.[34]GeneticsHeritability estimates of insomnia vary between 38% in males to 59% in females.[38] A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 3 genomic loci and 7 genes that influence the risk of insomnia, and showed that insomnia is highly polygenic.[39] In particular, a strong positive association was observed for the MEIS1 gene in both males and females. This study showed that the genetic architecture of insomnia strongly overlaps with psychiatric disorders and metabolic traits.Substance-inducedAlcohol-inducedMain article: Alcohol use and sleepAlcohol is often used as a form of self-treatment of insomnia to induce sleep. However, alcohol use to induce sleep can be a cause of insomnia. Long-term use of alcohol is associated with a decrease in NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of REM sleep and REM sleep fragmentation. Frequent moving between sleep stages occurs, with awakenings due to headaches, the need to urinate, dehydration, and excessive sweating. Glutamine rebound also plays a role as when someone is drinking; alcohol inhibits glutamine, one of the body\'s natural stimulants. When the person stops drinking, the body tries to make up for lost time by producing more glutamine than it needs. The increase in glutamine levels stimulates the brain while the drinker is trying to sleep, keeping him/her from reaching the deepest levels of sleep.[40] Stopping chronic alcohol use can also lead to severe insomnia with vivid dreams. During withdrawal REM sleep is typically exaggerated as part of a rebound effect.[41]Benzodiazepine-inducedLike alcohol, benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam, are commonly used to treat insomnia in the short-term (both prescribed and self-medicated), but worsen sleep in the long-term. While benzodiazepines can put people to sleep (i.e., inhibit NREM stage 1 and 2 sleep), while asleep, the drugs disrupt sleep architecture: decreasing sleep time, delaying time to REM sleep, and decreasing deep slow-wave sleep (the most restorative part of sleep for both energy and mood).[42][43][44]Opioid-inducedOpioid medications such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, and morphine are used for insomnia that is associated with pain due to their analgesic properties and hypnotic effects. Opioids can fragment sleep and decrease REM and stage 2 sleep. By producing analgesia and sedation, opioids may be appropriate in carefully selected patients with pain-associated insomnia.[28] However, dependence on opioids can lead to long-term sleep disturbances.[45]', 'Beauty', 'beauty,pretty,love,attraction,lust', '1556140805.jpg', 'A Beautiful Flower', 'active', NULL, NULL, '15', 'Apr,21,2019 07:55:34 PM', NULL),
(13, 'A Lonely Guy', 'In October 2012, hacker Aiden Pearce and his mentor and partner, Damien Brenks, conduct an electronic bank heist at the high-end Merlaut Hotel in Chicago and trigger a silent alarm set by another hacker. Brenks tries to find the hacker, giving himself and Pearce away. Fearing for his family, Pearce drives them to safety in the guise of a surprise trip to the country. On the way, hitman Maurice Vega fires a gunshot which crashes the car; Pearce\'s niece lapses into a coma and dies. 11 months later, Pearce tracks down Vega at a baseball stadium in the Parker Square district of Chicago. After a fruitless interrogation about Vega\'s contractor, he leaves Vega in the hands of his partner, Jordi Chin. While investigating, Brenks approaches Pearce with a request to find the other hacker from the Merlaut job. Pearce refuses, and Brenks retaliates by kidnapping his younger sister, which forces Pearce to comply with Brenks\' demands. With the help of Clara Lille, a member of the hacking syndicate DedSec, Pearce tracks down the second hacker‚Äîgang leader and former soldier Delford \'Iraq\' Wade‚Äîand obtains a data sample from Wade\'s servers. He and Lille discover that Wade has information on almost every citizen of Chicago, protecting his gang from the authorities.\r\n\r\nWhen they come across encrypted data beyond Lille\'s ability she tells Pearce to find Raymond Kenney, whose hacking caused the Northeast blackout of 2003 which led to the implementation of the ctOS operating system. After meeting Pearce and completing several tasks for him, Kenney agrees to help decrypt the data. Pearce assaults Wade\'s compound, and downloads its server data. Wade confronts him, but Pearce kills him and leaves the compound. Another hacker, JB \"Defalt\" Markowicz, infiltrates their system, steals the information and deletes it from their servers. Markowicz leaves a recording that discloses Lille\'s involvement in locating Pearce and Brenks during the Merlaut job, which resulted in the death of Pearce\'s niece. Pearce angrily tells Lille to leave. When the authorities later confront Brenks about the loss of the server data, he tells them Pearce\'s identity. Pearce and Kenney find and take down Markowicz, retrieving the data in a car chase.\r\n\r\nPearce discovers where his sister is being held, frees her, and they drive to nearby Pawnee for safety. Kenney finds the contractor who ordered the hit on Pearce\'s niece: Dermot Quinn, owner of the Merlaut Hotel. Pearce confronts Quinn, shutting off his pacemaker by hacking it. The dying Quinn says that he ordered the hit because he thought Pearce was searching for secret video footage of Mayor Donovan Rushmore (with whom Quinn is associated), who accidentally murdered his secretary when she threatened to expose his dealings with Quinn. After Quinn dies, Pearce races to Lille (who is ambushed and gunned down by Brenks\' men). Pearce uploads the video of Mayor Rushmore. He tries to find Brenks, who has unlocked ctOS (giving him access to the city). Pearce infects ctOS with a virus which shuts down the system, causing a citywide blackout. He thus reaches Brenks, who is hiding in a lighthouse. Chin arrives, saying that he has switched allegiance, but Pearce injures him and kills Brenks. Chin calls Pearce one last time to tell him where Vega is kept; Pearce heads there, and decides his fate.\r\n\r\nBad Blood\r\nA year after the main events of Watch Dogs, in 2014, Kenney decided to leave Chicago after performing what he thought was his last hacking job: removing more data about him from the Blume servers and planting a fake trail to lead Blume away from him. However, he later learned that this wasn\'t the case as he received a call from Tobias Frewer, asking for help after he had been kidnapped by Fixers and stuffed in the trunk of their vehicle. After rescuing Frewer, Kenney realized that if the Fixers knew where to find Frewer, they would eventually find him. He decided to get the Fixers off of his and Frewer\'s scents completely.\r\n\r\nKenney learned that Markowicz was the one behind the Fixers who have been looking for him. After learning where he was, Kenney managed to sneak inside the building and find mannequins representing the people who had died during the blackout he had caused years ago. He later came across an empty room with TV screens playing news footage of what had happened in 2003, causing an angry Kenney to smash the screens in, all while screaming that he had no intention of anyone dying during the blackout. Suddenly, a hanging mannequin with a Defalt mask came falling from the ceiling as Kenney realized that Markowicz\'s brother was one of the people who had died in the blackout, and that for Markowicz this whole thing was on a much more personal scale. Kenney managed to escape the building after killing the Fixers who were sent to kill him.\r\n\r\nWith Frewer\'s help, Kenney found out where Markowicz was hiding, making his way there along with Frewer. Once inside, Kenney was stuck in a room and was faced with not only Markowicz but also the other people whose loved ones were killed by the blackout. The room was then filled with gas; Markowicz\'s last attempt to kill Kenney. Luckily for Kenney, Frewer had his phone on him, which Kenney hacked in order to reroute the ventilation in the room he was in and the room Markowicz was in, killing Markowicz in the process. Managing to survive, Kenney decided to stay in Chicago, once Frewer agreed to help him in his fight against Blume, also hoping to recruit Pearce into their group.\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\nBeginning in 2009 with ten people and expanding to over a thousand,[23][24][25] Watch Dogs was developed for over five years (from prototype to finished game)[26] on a budget of about $68 million.[27] Before its announcement in 2012, the game had the working title of Nexus.[28] The initial sales pitch was the notion that one could control an entire city with the push of a button.[26]\r\n\r\nWatch Dogs runs on the game engine Disrupt, which developer Ubisoft Montreal created for it[29] (although it was originally intended for another game in the Driver franchise).[30] According to producer Dominic Guay, Disrupt has three pillars: simulation of the environment and its contents, how the environment can be affected, and the connectivity of a seamless online experience.[31] Director Jonathan Morin said that the PlayStation 4 technology allowed for better wind and water simulations and artificial intelligence.[23]\r\n\r\nRegional colloquialisms specific to Chicago were added to give the game authenticity. The developer traveled to the city several times for field research, photos, recording audio, meeting people, and interviewing the Chicago Police Department to gain insight. Landmarks were designed to only resemble their real-life counterparts, because their artistic rights would have tripled the budget. Fictionalizing Chicago allowed them to fit several district themes on one map.[25][32] The city was chosen as the setting for its contradictory nature, with great wealth and abject poverty.[14] Morin said that after it was chosen, Chicago became the most-surveilled city in America.[33]\r\n\r\nThe developers noted that character movements in games like Assassin\'s Creed were the same in every situation, and attempted to rectify this in Watch Dogs to contextualize protagonist Aiden Pearce.[23] The in-game control system ctOS was based on the SCADA system, and the story was inspired by the cyber-attack by the computer worm Stuxnet on SCADA.[34] The developers consulted the cyber-security company Kaspersky Lab (which discovered the Stuxnet worm) about the hacking features to increase their authenticity.[35][36] To create hacking factions in the game (like DedSec), the developer was influenced by the hacktivist group Anonymous, state-sponsored hackers, and tales of corporate espionage.[34]\r\n\r\nGrand Theft Auto and Saints Row were studied to develop complex controls, so the core hacking mechanic was reduced to a single button.[26] When the game was delayed, ideas long set aside (like the hacking of a headset) could be implemented.[37] The score, by Brian Reitzell, was released on vinyl and CD by Invada Records in partnership with Ubisoft Music on July 28, 2014.[38] Reitzell began composing by reading the script, concluding that krautrock would suit Watch Dogs.[28] The game was released to manufacturing in May 2014.[24]', 'Games', 'game,play,watchdog', '1556140748.jpg', 'WatchDog Wallpaper', 'active', NULL, NULL, '15', '08:42:37 PM 21-Apr-2019', NULL),

After many years, the Minions become depressed, restless, and unmotivated without a master to serve. To regain their dignity and sense of purpose, Kevin, one fearless Minion, decides to set out to find a new master and asks for help. Stuart, a musically inclined, one-eyed Minion, and Bob, a young and inexperienced but enthusiastic Minion, are recruited.\r\n\r\nThe trio journey to New York, when the year is 1968. After spending the day attempting to blend in, the Minions end up in a department store for the night, where they discover a hidden commercial broadcast for villains advertising Villain-Con; a convention for villains and supervillains in Orlando. The trio hitchhikes a ride with the Nelson family and impress them with their accidental villainy. At the convention, they see Scarlet Overkill, the first female supervillain, who unexpectedly hires them and takes them to her home in England. They phone the rest of the Minions to get them to join.\r\n\r\nScarlet explains the plan to steal the Imperial State Crown from the Queen of England and promises to reward the Minions if they steal it but kill them if they do not. Her husband, Herb, supplies them with inventions to aid in the heist, but they are nearly caught when they break into the Tower of London, which leads to a chase that ends with Bob accidentally crashing into the Sword in the Stone and pulling it free, removing the Queen from the throne and becoming King Bob. Enraged that somebody else accomplishes her dream of stealing the throne, Scarlet confronts the Minions, so Bob abdicates the throne in her favor. Undeterred because she feels betrayed, Scarlet imprisons the three in a dungeon to be tortured by Herb before her coronation, but they escape with the intention to apologize to Scarlet.\r\n\r\nAfter making their way to Westminster Abbey, Stuart and Bob interrupt the coronation by inadvertently dropping a chandelier on Scarlet, who orders their execution. Dozens of villains chase the three of them during a thunderstorm; Stuart and Bob are caught, while Kevin finds his way into a pub. He sees Scarlet on a television, promising that she will kill Stuart and Bob if Kevin does not show up by dawn. With the villains still searching for him, Kevin sneaks into Scarlet\'s castle to steal weapons. But right before the villains catch him, Kevin accidentally triggers a machine Herb was building and grows until he is thirty stories tall, destroying the castle. He tramples through London, rescuing his friends and battling Scarlet just as the other Minions turn up in London. Scarlet tries to eradicate them, but Kevin swallows a massive missile she fires at them. Scarlet and Herb attempt to escape with her rocket-dress, but Kevin holds onto it. The missile detonates, causing it to explode. The other Minions stare at the explosion in sadness but Kevin turns out to have survived and shrunk back to his normal size.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth II gets her throne and crown back and rewards Bob with a tiny crown for his teddy bear, Stuart with an electric guitar and Kevin with a knighthood. Scarlet and Herb, who turn out to have also survived the explosion, steal the crown once more only to be frozen in place by a young Gru, who flees with the crown on a rocket-powered motorbike.

(19, 'The Construction of Eiffel Tower', 'Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.[15] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2 m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft)[16] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.\r\n\r\nEach shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.5 m (25 ft) long. The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began. The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.[17] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 0.1 mm (0.0039 in) and angles worked out to one second of arc. The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration. In all, 18,038 pieces were joined together using 2.5 million rivets.[15]\r\n\r\nAt first the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level, construction was paused in order to create a substantial timber scaffold. This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \"Eiffel Suicide!\" and \"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\" appeared in the tabloid press.[18] At this stage, a small \"creeper\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg. They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs. The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888.[15] Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments in order to precisely align the legs; hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold. Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[15] only one person died, due to Eiffel\'s safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens.', 'Construction and Infrastructure', 'eiffel,tower,paris,france', '1556140872.jpg', 'Eiffel Tower', 'active', NULL, NULL, '18', '05:33:20 PM 24-Apr-2019', NULL),
(20, 'Is self-driving car going to be the future?', 'Experiments have been conducted on automated driving systems (ADS) since at least the 1920s;[7] trials began in the 1950s. The first truly automated car was developed in 1977, by Japan\'s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory. The vehicle tracked white street markers, which were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle, using an analog computer for signal processing. The vehicle reached speeds up to 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph), with the support of an elevated rail.[8][9]\r\n\r\nAutonomous prototype cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University\'s Navlab[10] and ALV[11][12] projects funded by DARPA starting in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich\'s EUREKA Prometheus Project[13] in 1987. By 1985, the ALV had demonstrated self-driving speeds on two-lane roads of 31 kilometres per hour (19 mph) with obstacle avoidance added in 1986 and off-road driving in day and nighttime conditions by 1987.[14] From the 1960s through the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the U.S. was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the U.S. Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence in more complex conditions, controls, and sensor systems.[15] Companies and research organizations have developed prototypes.[13][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23]\r\n\r\nThe U.S. allocated $650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation, embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure. The program concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.[24] Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove 4,584 kilometres (2,848 mi) across America in 1995, 4,501 kilometres (2,797 mi) or 98% of it autonomously.[25] Navlab\'s record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015 when Delphi improved it by piloting an Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over 5,472 kilometres (3,400 mi) through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.[26] In 2015, the US states of Nevada, Florida, California, Virginia, and Michigan, together with Washington, D.C., allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.[27]\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Audi stated that its latest A8 would be automated at speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 mph) using its \"Audi AI.\" The driver would not have to do safety checks such as frequently gripping the steering wheel. The Audi A8 was claimed to be the first production car to reach level 3 automated driving, and Audi would be the first manufacturer to use laser scanners in addition to cameras and ultrasonic sensors for their system.[28]\r\n\r\nIn November 2017, Waymo announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position;[29] however, there was still an employee in the car.[30] In October 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had traveled in automated mode for over 10,000,000 miles (16,000,000 km), increasing by about 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 kilometres) per month.[31] In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialize a fully autonomous taxi service in the U.S.[32]', 'Cars and Vehicles', 'cars,self-driven,fast,future,science,technology', '1556140679.jpg', 'Cool cars!', 'active', NULL, NULL, '15', '07:27:22 PM 24-Apr-2019', NULL),
(21, 'What actually happened is Avengers: Endgame?', 'After Thanos activates the completed Infinity Gauntlet,[N 1] Clint Barton\'s family disintegrates along with half of all life across the universe. Nebula and Tony Stark are stranded in space following their defeat by Thanos, but Carol Danvers returns them to Earth and reunites them with Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Rocket, Thor, Pepper Potts and James Rhodes. The team formulate a plan to steal the Infinity Stones back from Thanos and use them to reverse his actions, but learn upon finding him that he had destroyed them to prevent their further use - prompting Thor to decapitate Thanos out of anger.\r\n\r\nFive years later, the Avengers have changed; Banner has succeeded in taking control of his Hulk side, while Thor has become the drunken, irresponsible ruler of the remnants of Asgard in T√∏nsberg - Norway. Meanwhile, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm[N 2] and discovers what has befallen the world in his absence. He meets up with Romanoff and Rogers, explaining to them that from his perspective, only five hours passed within quantum realm. Theorizing that the quantum realm can be used to travel through time, the three propose to Stark ‚Äî who is now raising a daughter, Morgan, with Pepper Potts ‚Äî that they travel back in time and retrieve the Infinity Stones before Thanos can collect them. Stark initially rejects their proposal out of concern over what altering history will mean for his child, but changes his mind after reflecting upon the loss of Peter Parker; Stark manages to design a working time machine..\r\n\r\nThe reunited Avengers split into groups for their mission. Banner, Rogers, Lang, and Stark travel back to the Battle of New York[N 3] to retrieve the Time, Mind, and Space Stones. Banner visits the Sanctum Sanctorum and convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone, with the promise that it will be returned. Rogers succeeds in stealing the Mind Stone from undercover Hydra agents, but stumbles across and fights his past self - who mistakes him for a disguised Loki. Lang and Stark\'s attempt to steal the Space Stone fails when the distraction they cause enables Loki to escape with it. While Lang and Banner return to the present, Rogers and Stark travel further back in time to a U.S. Army installation in 1970,[N 4] to steal both an earlier version of the Space Stone and further vials of Hank Pym\'s size-altering Pym Particles in order to make the journey back home. Despite encounters with Peggy Carter and Stark\'s father Howard, the pair succeed.\r\n\r\nRocket and Thor travel to Asgard to retrieve the Reality Stone from Jane Foster[N 5] While Rocket achieves their objective, Thor has a chance encounter with his mother Frigga, whose counsel restores his conviction before her death. He obtains a past version of his hammer, Mj√∂lnir,[N 6] and reunites with Rocket before the duo return to the present. Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir to retrieve the Soul Stone. They hesitate when Johann Schmidt, keeper of the Soul Stone, informs them that the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone they love. Ultimately, Romanoff sacrifices herself and Barton then takes the Soul Stone back to Earth.\r\n\r\nNebula and Rhodes travel to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill does.[N 7] Rhodes returns to the present with the stone, but Nebula malfunctions before she can do so - a consequence of her computer-brain\'s neural network interfacing with that of her own past self. Via the Nebulas\' link, the past incarnation of Thanos learns of the future, his success in his plans to wipe out half the universe, and the Avengers\' attempt to thwart him. Nebula is captured by Thanos, and the past incarnation of Nebula is sent back to the present in her place. Banner successfully uses the Infinity Stones to resurrect everyone killed by Thanos, but not before Nebula\'s past self uses the time machine to transport Thanos and his army from the past to the Avengers facility. The facility is reduced to rubble, and in the chaos, Barton recovers the Infinity Stones; when the past Nebula attempts to take them from him, she is killed by her future self. Rogers, Thor, and Stark confront Thanos, who has decided to instead use the Infinity Stones to destroy the universe and create a new one in his vision; Rogers proves able to lift Thor\'s hammer, but even it is not enough to defeat Thanos. Doctor Strange and Wong then arrive to teleport all of the revived Avengers, their allies, sorcerers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to the ruins to join the fight against Thanos and his army. After a lengthy battle, Stark eventually rips the Infinity Stones from Thanos\' hand and uses them to turn him and his entire army into dust, but the energy released by the Stones fatally wounds him. Parker, Rhodes, and Potts comfort Stark as he dies.\r\n\r\nFollowing the battle, the Avengers hold a funeral for Stark. Thor appoints Valkyrie the Queen of Asgard and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy. Meanwhile, Rogers returns the Infinity Stones and Thor\'s hammer to their original timelines, but decides to live the rest of his life in the past with Carter instead of returning to the present.

At that time Latin was the language of scholarship. A \"universitas\" was a guild of masters (MAs) with licence to teach. \"Degree\" and \"graduate\" come from gradus, meaning \"step\". The first step was admission to a bachelor\'s degree. The second step was the masters step, giving the graduate admission to the universitas and license to teach. Typical dress for graduation is gown and hood, or hats adapted from the daily dress of university staff in the Middle Ages, which was in turn based on the attire worn by medieval clergy.[4]\r\n\r\nThe tradition of wearing graduation hats in Sweden has been in place since the mid-eighteenth century. The cap is typically a white sailor hat with a black or dark blue band around it, a crown motif, and a black peak at the front.

The headgear then became popular across several other European nations as well.', 'Study', 'study,graduation,bachelor,masters,phd', '1556212271.jpg', 'Graduation Photo', 'active', NULL, NULL, '34', '05:11:11 PM 25-Apr-2019', NULL),
(24, 'Why do people love or as some say \"FALL IN LOVE\"?', 'A question that receives quite a bit of attention in the psychological literature is why people fall in love. One promising answer is that romantic love occurs when the attributes that generate general attraction and the social factors and circumstances that produce passion are particularly strong.\r\n\r\nThe general attraction attributes are as follows (Aron, et al. 1989):\r\n\r\nSimilarity: This includes similarity of people‚Äôs beliefs and, to a lesser extent, similarity of personality traits and ways of thinking.\r\nPropinquity: This includes familiarity with the other, which can be caused by spending time together, living near each other, thinking about the other, or anticipating interaction with the other.\r\nDesirable characteristics: This general attraction attribute is particularly focused on an outer physical appearance that is found desirable and, to a lesser extent, on desirable personality traits.\r\nReciprocal liking: When the other person is attracted to you or likes you, that can increase your own liking.\r\nTwo further factors that can help explain why people fall in love involve mate selection (Aron, et al. 1989):\r\n\r\nSocial influences: A potential union that satisfies general social norms, as well as acceptance of the potential union within one‚Äôs social network, can contribute to people falling in love. By contrast, a union that does not satisfy general social norms or is not accepted by one‚Äôs social network, can result in people falling out of love.\r\nFilling needs: If a person can fulfill needs for companionship, love, sex or mating, there is a greater chance that the other person will fall in love with him or her.\r\nAnother five factors seem to be required for the love to be truly passionate as opposed to being a kind of friendship love (Aron, et al. 1989):\r\n\r\nArousal/unusualness: Being in an unusual or arousing environment can spark passion, even if the environment is perceived as dangerous or spooky (Dutton & Aron, 1974).\r\nSpecific Cues: A particular feature of the other may spark particularly strong attraction (e.g., parts of their body or facial features).\r\nReadiness: The more you want to be in a relationship, the lower your self-esteem and the more likely you are to fall in love.\r\nIsolation: Spending time alone with another person can also contribute to a development of passion.\r\nMystery: If there is some mystery surrounding the other person and uncertainty about what the other person thinks or feels, wondering when he or she will initiate contact can also contribute to passion.\r\nAron et al. (1989) examined which of these factors are most prevalent in college students based on their descriptions of their experiences of falling in love. The researchers found that the most frequently mentioned factor preceding experiences of love was finding certain characteristics of the other person desirable, as well as reciprocity of the experienced emotions. There was a moderate frequency of descriptions mentioning the factors that spark passion (e.g., readiness, arousal/unusualness). There was a low to moderate frequency of descriptions of the other person being perceived as similar to the research participant.', 'Love', 'love', '1556212460.jpg', 'Love is beautiful', 'active', NULL, NULL, '34', '05:14:20 PM 25-Apr-2019', NULL),
(25, 'How plants have been the savior to mankind and how we treat them now!', 'n order to understand how trees relate to global warming, you first have to understand what the greenhouse effect is.\r\nJust like a greenhouse traps heat inside, Earth has a \"natural greenhouse effect\" in which some of the sun\'s infrared radiation is trapped to warm the planet. In the atmosphere, there are certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides, ozone, and water vapor, which aid in this process by reflecting the heat back to earth. This process allows Earth to maintain a comfortable temperature. (An average of around 57 degrees Fahrenheit) If this radiation is not trapped, the average temperature on earth would drop to zero degrees Fahrenheit, (-18 degrees Celsius), and life would not be as we know it today.\r\nIn this way, these greenhouse gases are very important and central to the survival of the living organisms on Earth. The greenhouse effect is what makes Earth so unique from the other planets; we have just the right amount of greenhouse gases to make for a suitable temperature.\r\nYet, too much of something is not a good thing, and in this case, the excess of these greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, in our atmosphere is detrimental to life and the environment. With a plethora of these gases being released into the atmosphere by human innovations, the greenhouse effect is enhancing and this is causing the rise in temperature that we have been experiencing in the last two centuries. Since 1750, (the beginning of the Industrial Revolution), the output of carbon dioxide alone has risen about 36%, and since 1880, which marks the end of the Industrial Revolution, Earth‚Äôs temperature has risen 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Although this may not seem like an enormous increase, the effects it leaves on the environment and the organisms that live in it are damaging and deadly. Many plants and animals cannot adapt to temperature changes in their environment quickly, and this is causing many to become endangered, and for some extinct\"(<a href=\'https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/green-science/deforestation_and_global_warming\'>global warming</a>\")\r\n‚ÄúEmissions‚Äù United States Environmental protection Agency April 14, 2011\r\n\"Poachers Take Ancient Red Cedar From Carmanah-Walbran Provincial Park\" Wildness Committee May 17, 2012\r\n\"So how do trees and deforestation relate to global warming?\r\nTrees play a huge role in the carbon cycle. They convert the CO2 in the air to oxygen, through the process of photosynthesis, and in this way, they can be looked at as a natural regulator of the carbon dioxide. The more trees, the less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the more oxygen.\r\nSince we live in an age where carbon dioxide is very abundant in the atmosphere, released through man-made inventions, such as cars, factories, and power plants, it is vital, more than ever, that trees fulfill their part in the environment and take some of the excess carbon dioxide out of the air. Unfortunately, deforestation is preventing this job to be fully accomplished, and with half of all the Earth\'s forests gone, and four million trees cut down each year just for paper use, the amount of carbon dioxide is rising. With more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, more of the sun\'s radiation is being reflected back to earth, instead of space, and this is causing our average temperature to rise. In this way, deforestation is a major issue when it comes to global warming.<a href=\'https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/green-science/deforestation_and_global_warming\'>GLOBAL WARMING</a>\r\n‚ÄúEmissions‚Äù United States Environmental protection Agency April 14, 2011\r\n\"Poachers Take Ancient Red Cedar From Carmanah-Walbran Provincial Park\" Wildness Committee May 17, 2012', 'Nature', 'plants,trees,life', '1556212697.jpg', 'Plants save life.', 'active', NULL, NULL, '34', '05:18:17 PM 25-Apr-2019', NULL);
